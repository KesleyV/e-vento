1) Project Name: E-vento

2) Development Proposal:
Purpose of the App It is an event management application that has a version for the Administrator, who can create, edit and delete events, in addition to validating qr codes generated by customers. Customers, in turn, can consult events, "buy" and generate qr codes of purchased events. All backend is done in firebase and the application uses api's via zip code and gopogle maps.

3) To run the app, just clone it in your environment (make sure you have all the base to run applications in flutter/dart) and, after that, run the flutter pub get command and, later, the flutter run -d all.

OBS: If the google maps api stops working, that's why I disabled the google cloud features.
